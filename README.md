# Hello World in Solidity

This Solidity program is a simple "Hello World" application that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language. It serves as a starting point for those new to Solidity and offers a feel for how the language works.

## Description

This program is a basic contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract contains a single function that returns the string "Hello World!". This serves as an introductory example and can be a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.

## Getting Started

### Executing the Program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Remix website](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a `.sol` extension (e.g., `HelloWorld.sol`).
3. Copy and paste the following code into the file:

    ```solidity
    pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

    contract HelloWorld {
        function sayHello() public pure returns (string memory) {
            return "Hello World!";
        }
    }
    ```

4. To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Ensure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile HelloWorld.sol" button.
5. Once the code is compiled, deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab. Select the "HelloWorld" contract from the dropdown menu and click on the "Deploy" button.
6. After deployment, interact with the contract by calling the `sayHello` function. Click on the "HelloWorld" contract in the left sidebar, then click on the `sayHello` function, and finally click the "transact" button to retrieve the "Hello World!" message.
